       " 'Foreword This handbook establishes the policies and procedures for the Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP). These guidelines include the processes for enrollment of travelers into the programs and the procedures for inspecting TTP members at the ports of entry. These programs are an essential element of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) strategy to secure our borders through increased advanced knowledge of the travelers. TTP participants are subject to rigorous vetting and random compliance checks to ensure the integrity of the programs. Shorter wait times and expedited procedures for Trusted Travelers at the ports of entry provide the incentive for participation in the programs. The handbook provides an overview and guidance for CBP officers and supervisors who are assigned at the enrollment centers as well as those at the ports of entry. Officers and supervisors are advised to check the CBP website often for TTP updates, changes, or additions to the policies and procedures outlined in this handbook. Frequent upgrades in technology, software, and issue resolutions result in recurrent procedural and/or policy changes.

       " '1. Overview of the Trusted Traveler Programs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is committed to enhancing legitimate trade and travel while maintaining the highest level of border security and integrity. In the reissuance of being able to operate our systems under the Privacy Act of 1974, DHS decided to combine the Trusted Traveler Programs and the Registered Traveler Programs (TRTP) under one notice to reduce the number of renewal submissions the agency has to provide to operate under the 1974 Privacy Act. Global Enrollment System (GES) is one of the systems under the broad category of TRTP. GES remains the system of record that officers use to collect biographic and biometric information. Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP) allow pre-enrolled, low- risk participants to receive expedited border processing, enabling CBP to direct additional scrutiny to the unknown, potentially higher risk travelers arriving at ports of entry. The integrity of the TTPs is maintained by a strict screening process that includes queries of multiple law enforcement databases and biometric validation of identity prior to enrollment; 24-hour checks to continually verify low-risk status of enrolled travelers; and a system of randomized referrals to secondary inspection to ensure Trusted Traveler members are in compliance with law and all policies and regulations specific to the TTP. There are currently four TTPs: Global Entry (GE), the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), NEXUS and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) Commercial Driver Program. The four TTPs use a harmonized Global Enrollment System (GES) and submission through an online cloud based TTP system linked to the (https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov) which will take you tothe Login.govidentity _Management system. From GES, applications are forwardedtothe_ (B7M(E) | ___(b)(7)(E) __!where they undergo a strict vetting process. If the applicant passes the preliminary vetting process, the applicant is instructed to schedule an enrollment interview, if required. Alternatively, conditionally approved GE applicants can also complete the enrollment process in conjunction with a CBP primary inspection via the Enrollment-On-Arrival (EoA) Program at select locations where CBP officers will confirm identity, review travel documents, verify admissibility status, complete ten-print fingerprint checks against IDENT and IAFIS, and conduct an interview of the applicant. If the officer determines that the applicant is eligible for the program, the applicant will be approved and enrolled into the TTP for a five-year period. 1.1, Global Entry GE provides expedited and secure processing when arriving internationally at designated United States (U.S.) airports and when departing CBP Preclearance locations. Travelers enrolled in GE utilize GE border processing technology in lieu of traditional primary inspections; sss (bY(7(E) (bE) Egress processes are in place to ensure that CBP officers confirm that travelers have been properly processed by GE technology prior to departing an FIS and are in compliance with CBP reporting requirements. The GE border processing technology uses a document reader to verify the travel document and compare biometric data to validate enrollment. CBP has commenced the Global Entry Modernization (GEM) initiative. Phase 1 of this initiative involves integrating Facial Comparison into the GE arrival experience. Under this program, GE border processing technology is modified to capture a photograph in lieu of the fingerprint and passport scan to verify the identity of GE members through comparison with traveler data stored in the GES, the Traveler Verification Service (TVS), and the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS). CBP has piloted and selected a technology solution to implement a touchless, receipt-less process for GE processing, but the legacy GE process remains programmed to issue a receipt. A GE radio-frequency identification (RFID) enabled card is issued to U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, and Mexican national GE members (not already enrolled in SENTRI or NEXUS) for use at the NEXUS and SENTRI lanes when 4 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000010',\n",
       " 'entering the U.S.. Please note that this card is not valid for use in the NEXUS lanes when traveling into Canada or with the NEXUS and GE border processing technology in an airport environment when entering the ULS..  1.2. SENTRI SENTRI provides expedited CBP processing for pre-approved, low-risk travelers at southern land border ports of entry. At some locations, the SENTRI program is available for both vehicle and pedestrian border crossers. Each of the participating ports have designated SENTRI vehicle and/or pedestrian lanes with access restricted to SENTRI members. Participation in SENTRI requires that vehicles used to cross the border must be registered and inspected. Members are issued RFID-enabled SENTRI cards. The SENTRI identification document satisfies the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) entry document requirements for citizens of the U.S. and Canada for land and sea travel. Access to the SENTRI vehicle lanes begins south of the border in Mexico, or on the access bridges, and is generally controlled by Mexican authorities.  1.3. NEXUS NEXUS is a bi-national TTP operated jointly by the U.S. and Canada. NEXUS provides expedited CBP and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) processing for travelers entering both the U.S. and Canada via the air, land, or marine environments. Each applicant must be approved by both CBP and CBSA prior to enrollment. At land border locations, NEXUS lanes are available for entry into the U.S. as well as Canada. Members are issued RFID-enabled NEXUS identification cards. The NEXUS identification card satisfies the WHTI entry document requirements for citizens of the U.S. and Canada for air, land, and marine travel. NEXUS members are eligible to use GE border processing technology for expedited CBP processing at airports, to include U.S. preclearance locations in Canada. At Canadian airports, NEXUS members may use NEXUS border processing technologies to enter Canada. The NEXUS border processing technologies use a biometric facial comparison or iris scan to verify program membership. NEXUS can also be utilized for small boat arrivals from Canada, providing expedited processing.  1.4. FAST The Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program is a Border Accord Initiative between the U.S. and Canada designed to ensure security and safety while enhancing the economic prosperity of each country. In developing this program, Canada and the U.S. have agreed to coordinate, to the maximum extent possible, their commercial processes for clearance of commercial shipments at the border. The program promotes free and secure trade by using common risk-management principles, industry partnership, and advanced technology to improve the efficiency of screening and clearing commercial traffic at our shared borders. With similar goals and techniques, the U.S. independently administers a version of FAST for low-risk imports from Mexico. There are two versions of the FAST Driver program — FAST North and FAST South. FAST participation requirements along the northern and southern border are very similar with minor exceptions: FAST North is a bi-national program administered jointly by CBP and the CBSA for expedited release into both countries, and FAST South is administered exclusively by CBP for expedited release into the U.S. with only inbound traffic management assisted by Mexican authorities. All occupants must have a valid FAST card at the time of crossing to utilize the FAST lanes; otherwise, regular service lanes must be used.  5 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000011',\n",
       " '1.5. APEC The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an inter-governmental forum for member economies in the Pacific Rim. Facilitating travel for qualified business travelers within the APEC region contributes to the business facilitation goal to free open trade and investment and to the U.S. economy. There are 19 fully participating APEC member economies including: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Hong Kong (China), China (Mainland), Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, and Vietnam. APEC cardholders that are granted a pre-clearance status by a fully participating APEC economy do not need to make a separate application for a visa or entry permit when traveling to one of the other fully participating economies. There are two APEC economies that are transitional members and not full APEC members: Canada and the U.S.. APEC cardholders from transitional economies are not able to receive pre-clearance status from fully participating economies and must present any visas, travel or other entry documents that are required for entry into their destination economy. Both fully participating and transitional members offer access to expedited immigration lanes at participating airports. A “verified businessperson” engaged in APEC business means a person engaged in the trade of goods, the provision of services, or the conduct of investment activities in the APEC region. Professional athletes, news correspondents, entertainers, musicians, artists, or persons engaged in similar occupations are not considered verified business travelers engaged in business in the APEC region when they are traveling in such a capacity. A “U.S. government official” means a U.S. government official performing U.S. government activities that support the work of APEC. 1.6. International Arrangements CBP has entered arrangements with GE foreign partner countries to facilitate travel and grant reciprocal expeditated entry benefits to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents who are GE members into foreign partner country travel entry programs. U.S. citizens and, U.S. LPRs must first acquire GE membership before they can acquire membership in a foreign partner country traveler program. Citizens of partner countries that CBP has arrangements with must be cleared by both CBP and the partner country government to receive GE benefits. Based on the bi-lateral agreement with the partner country, the applicant must initiate the process by submitting an online application for GE through the TTP website or with their primary country of citizenship. To find further information on existing arrangements for specific partner countries, please visit: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler- programs/global-entry/international-arrangements. Bilateral Framework e A Joint Statement is signed with the partner country, which establishes the framework for the trusted traveler arrangement. e Applications will be vetted by each country against mutually agreed upon criteria and databases. Disqualifying criteria must also be mutually agreed upon. e Applicant must be approved and deemed “low-risk” by both countries. ¢ Both countries will exchange program status on a “pass/fail” basis. No additional information is exchanged other than the data necessary to complete vetting. 6 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000012',\n",
       " \"e Both countries must agree upon a recurrent vetting schedule. e ff amember is revoked from the program, a message is sent to the partner country to indicate that the member is no longer in the program. AIL GE members who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. LPRs must maintain updated visa information with CBP and must have a valid machine-readable passport, ESTA or a valid visa. If a GE member obtains a new visa, or obtains a new petition for a work visa, the member must notify CBP in- person at a GE enrollment center. Amember must visit an enrollment center to have CBP add a new visa and/or update visa information. If the visa information is incomplete or not properly updated with CBP, the GE Border Processing Technology may incorrectly calculate the member’s Class-of-Admission and admission date. As previously stated, a member must visit an enrollment center in-person to add or update visa information. 2.

       " '| eenenaeenenaeAPMTNE) | In accordance with existing facility security policies, CBP officers assigned to enrollment centers may refuse entry to TTP applicants, individuals accompanying TTP applicants, or any individual who has not been pre-screened by CBP. If a TTP applicant is refused access to the enrollment center, the circumstances must be documented in GES comments, in addition to any other reporting requirements. Pre-screened applicants with Conditionally Approved TTP status will be notified by email, that they are now eligible to continue the application process by completing the TTP interview. The interview can be completed either through EoA (only for GE), at an Enrollment Center (EC), or virtually through a remote interview (if eligible). Conditionally approved applicants using the TTP website may schedule an appointment at an EC. If an applicant has not scheduled the interview or completed their interview through EoA within 365 days of the conditional approval notification, the application is deemed abandoned and is automatically cancelled by GES. If an applicant is unable to schedule an interview within the 365-day time frame due to extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness, schooling, or extended vacations, the applicant may contact the EC and an EC supervisor can generate a request to the TTP program office for the application to be reinstated. EC personnel are required to use the TTP internal website page to manage interview appointments and to maintain a window of availability for appointments. ECs can determine the number of appointments ona daily basis and how far in advance to have the schedule open to ensure appointment availability, based on operational needs not to hinder with primary functions. Generally, good practice is to make appointment availability within a reasonable time-period — 90 days or less. The EC hours and available appointment slots should be monitored locally and adjusted as necessary to accommodate increases in the number of applicants. The TTP Internal site limits appointment times to 15 minutes, but interviews can last as long as necessary for the officer to deem the applicant as low risk. Time permitting, ECs should make every effort to accommodate walk-ins for conditionally approved applicants seeking an interview. Walk-ins for reasons other than an interview should always be accommodated. For example, a TTP member needing to update biographic information or travel documents cannot schedule an appointment via their TTP account.  8.1.2. Enrollment on Arrival Conditionally approved GE applicants are eligible to complete the interview portion of the enrollment process at any of the participating airports in the U.S. and Pre-Clearance locations when returning from international travel. An updated list of participating airports is located on the CBP gov website via the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/enrollment-arrival 8.1.3. Remote Interviews The TTP remote interview program was developed to allow qualified applicants to complete their interview virtually with a CBP officer using Zoom for Government or another approved system.

Global Entry Program Specifics 9.1, Global Entry Program Benefits GE provides “head of the line” privileges at all participating airports for all TTP members. Additionally, GE members may perform their CBP primary inspection using automated GE border processing technology. GE members may use the SENTRI lanes at southern land border ports of entry, provided they travel ina SENTRI registered vehicle and comply with SENTRI requirements. GE members can also use the SENTRI pedestrian lanes. SENTRI program benefits are covered under TTP Handbook section 10.1. SENTRI members who are U.S. citizens or LPRs and NEXUS members receive GE benefits provided the required documents and fingerprints are on file in GES. NEXUS members and eligible SENTRI members with incomplete information in GES may obtain GE benefits by providing fingerprints and document information at an EC. 9.2, Global Entry FIS Setup Professional Service Managers (PSM) shall work with the local airport/airline staff to identify the most effective ways to route GE members to the GE border processing technology (such as signage or airline staff directing traffic). In the event of a referral or if the GE border processing technology is down, GE members are to be provided “head of the line” privileges at locations where the program is operational, to include on primary, in secondary, and at the egress control point. GE members should never be sent to the back of the line. 28 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000034',\n",

A dedicated GE Lane must be available at the egress point if applicable (i.e., no more egress at SA locations). At ports where a dedicated lane at egress is not practical, GE members should be provided “head of the line” privileges. Signs should be placed in the FIS. directing GE members where to exit. 9.3. Global Entry Passenger Processing 9.3.1. Membership Validation Upon arrival into the U.S. at an airport(s) or at Preclearance location(s) without GE facial comparison capabilities, a member will scan his/her machine-readable travel document at the GE border processing technology. An electronic validation of their membership is performed in GES and the GE border processing technology will prompt the member to provide fingerprints. This will also satisfy reporting requirements, if applicable. It is important to note that only documents that correspond to the citizenship the traveler presented during enrollment under can be used at the GE border processing technology. For example, for a dual national who holds Spanish and Mexican citizenship and enrolls in GE as a Mexican citizen, only the Mexican passport may be used at the GE border processing technology. Any required visa must be in the Mexican passport in order for it to be used in conjunction with GE. CBP uses a facial comparison algorithm as part of the CBP Traveler Verification Service (TVS) for traveler identity processing at air, land and sea entry and exit. TVS searches live traveler photos against facial image galleries to assist in the identification of arriving or departing travelers. How It Works A traveler’s facial features are the key to Phase 1: GE Facial Comparison - instead of using a traveler’s primary travel document, GE border processing technology uses the traveler’s face to verify identity in CBP systems. GE Facial Comparison technology accelerates the admission process by reducing the steps and time the GE border processing technology requires to process travelers.

       " '1. Using airline manifest data, CBP retrieves existing traveler images from government holdings, including passports, visas, and past encounter photos, and builds a photo gallery of likely travelers in TVS.  2. As travelers approach the GE border processing technology, the GE border processing technology captures a photo of the traveler and compares the image to the pre-assembled TVS gallery. CBP matches the live image to one from the gallery and verifies the associated traveler information.  3. The GE border processing technology validates the results, determines the class of admission, and admits the traveler to the U.S.. The GE border processing technology will issue a printed receipt with the results of the transaction, which the traveler will be required to present to CBP Officers when exiting the inspection area to confirm program compliance.  9.3.2. Primary Background Checks Once membership has been validated, the GE border processing technology will initiate system checks. The checks involve a real time query of the following systems:  e TECS;  e NCIC;  ° APIS;  e IDENT; and  e ESTA.  9.3.3. Legacy Global Entry Border Processing Technology Receipt When the member successfully completes processing at the GE border processing technology, a printed receipt will be issued.

CBP Declaration GE members utilizing the GE border processing technology are not required to fill out a physical CBP Declaration Form (6059B). However, members are responsible for making a truthful declaration at the GE border processing technology. Like other travelers, GE members are allowed to make amended oral declarations subsequent to responding to CBP declaration questions on the GE border processing technology. The GE border processing technology will prompt members to answer yes (“Y”) or no (“N”) to the CBP Declaration questions found on the Form 6059B. When the member answers “Y” to any of the questions, the member will be confirmed in Simplified Arrival (SA) and a declaration referral (DR) will be generated by the GE border processing technology. The referral will instruct the member to proceed to Baggage Control. A circle will be printed on the receipt, as well as the questions that were answered with a “yes” response. Modified egress, CBP personnel will determine whether further examination is warranted.  9.3.5. Required Documentation GE members who have completed processing and are ready to exit the FIS must present their travel document and their GE border processing technology receipt to designated CBP personnel at the egress point if the FIS doesn’t support modified egress. Unless a member is referred by the GE border processing technology or selected for a random exams.  9.3.6. CBP Officer’s Responsibilities at Exit Point Facial Comparison with receipt: The CBP officer responsible for checking travelers as they exit the FIS area must:  e Verify that the identity of the traveler matches the DHS-approved travel document and is the same as the identity on the GE border processing technology receipt, because of technology advancements, now the GE border processing technology incorporates a photo on the receipt,  e Verify that the time the traveler cleared the GE border processing technology is within a reasonable time frame from the time the traveler is exiting the FIS.

A minimum of one (1) officer will be stationed at the end of the lines to check GE border processing technology receipts. Ports can assign additional officers based on local operational factors. Should the daily security code on the GE border processing technology receipt not match the code of day or the traveler does not match the receipt photo, the member must be immediately escorted to Passport Control Secondary for further examination. 31 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000037',\n",
       " 'Facial Comparison Procedures: The GE border processing technology will no longer prompt the traveler to provide a Customs Declaration. The process is referred to as a Negative Declaration Inspection. The traveler will provide an oral declaration when they present their receipt to the CBP officer upon exit of the FIS or at the egress point. Airports may establish two lines: NOTHING TO DECLARE & ARTICLES TO DECLARE. A minimum of one (1) officer will be stationed at the end of the lines to check GE border processing technology receipts and take an oral declaration. Ports can assign additional officers based on local operational factors. Follows the same protocols as Simplified Arrival in obtaining an oral declaration.  9.4. Equipment Maintenance It is the responsibility of the Duty Supervisory to check that the GE border processing technology is operational, thei______(b)(7)(E)________ scanners are regularly cleaned. When the equipment is not functioning, the Duty Supervisor will report it to the Help Desk.  9.5. Airports without Global Entry border processing technology At airports without GE border processing technology, a dedicated lane or “head of the line” procedures must be in place for all CBP Trusted Travelers to use.  9.6, Global Entry Cards On July 12, 2011, CBP began issuing GE cards to U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, and Mexican nationals enrolled in the program. The sole purpose of the cards is to allow U.S. citizens, U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents, and Mexican nationals enrolled in GE expedited processing at U.S. land borders. The GE cards are WHTI compliant documents for land and sea travel that are RFID chip enabled. These cards are valid for use at the SENTRI and NEXUS lanes coming into the U.S.. However, GE cards are not valid for entry into Canada via the NEXUS lanes and GE border processing technologies, and members must use a passport or U.S. LPR card to facilitate their entry. When using the SENTRI lanes, GE members must comply with SENTRI vehicle requirements. 10. SENTRI Program Specifics  10,1. SENTRI Program Benefits SENTRI members use dedicated processing lanes at southern land border crossings. SENTRI members may use the NEXUS lanes when entering the U.S. from Canada by land, and GE when entering the U.S. by air. In the case of non-LPR Mexican national SENTRI members, the member must submit a GE application via TTP website or login.gov. The Mexican national must consent to and pass vetting by the Government of Mexico in order to obtain GE benefits. If the member fails vetting by the Government of Mexico, the member will be denied GE benefits and be revoked from SENTRI.  32 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000038',\n",
       " 'Approved GE and NEXUS members who are in possession of a TTP RFID enabled card may use the SENTRI lanes, provided they are traveling in a SENTRI registered vehicle. Members can also use the SENTRI pedestrian lanes. SENTRI members who are U.S. citizens or U.S. LPRs may also use GE border processing technology.  10.2. Required Vehicle Information & Registration for SENTRI Lanes All vehicles used to enter the U.S. in a SENTRI lane must be registered in the program. If an applicant is applying for GE and is utilizing the program benefits to cross the southern border, the vehicle must be enrolled in the GE program. All vehicles enrolled in either the SENTRI or GE program must comply with both U.S. and Mexican laws. A TTP applicant can register a maximum of four vehicles for use in the program. A vehicle can be included and vetted with an initial application (no additional fee). Additional vehicles must be added via a Vehicle Add application, and the associated $42 dollar fee will be collected. During the enrollment interview, vehicle registrations may be scanned into GES. If an applicant is not the vehicle(s) registered owner, written authorization from the registered owner must be provided. If the registered owner is not present, the authorization must be notarized (in English). For company-owned vehicles, vehicle authorizations must be submitted on company letterhead and signed by an executive officer of the company. A copy of the vehicle authorization will be scanned into GES and the original will be returned to the applicant. Please note that the following information is mandatory for SENTRI vehicles in GES:  ¢ Conveyance type — motorcycle, or vehicle;  « ID number — vehicle identification number;  e Registered country;  e Registered state/province;  e License plate number; and,  * Owner type — applicant, business, individual not the applicant. Despite not having an inspection at the time of enrollment, vehicles will still be subject to inspections at the time of crossing. Newly registered vehicles will be subject to a random referral during the first  through third crossing to ensure a complete! (b)(7)(E)! inspection and appropriate TECS queries__ (b)(7)(E)__ | i(b)(7)(E): are conducted.  A vehicle is not required to be registered in the state it is being enrolled in and the driver is not required to be in possession of a driver’s license for the state that the vehicle is being enrolled in. The driver must show proof of insurance for the vehicle, but it does not have to be under the applicant’s policy.  10.3. SENTRI Lane Inspections — Vehicle Processing TTP members may only use a vehicle that is registered with the SENTRI/GE program, including motorcycles. The driver of the vehicle will hold the SENTRI/NEXUS/GE card(s) in front of the RFID reader prior to reaching the primary booth. The CBP officer on primary will ensure that the correct license plate information is queried in TECSbME!On primary. The license plate captured by the license plate reader must be compared to the actual license plate on the vehicle in the Dedicated Commuter Lane (DCL).

The officer will perform a regular (non-Trusted Traveler) inspection on such travelers. When such permission is granted, the travelers will be informed that planned regular use of the DCL, even while traveling on official duty, will require enrollment in the program.  10.4, SENTRI — Pedestrian Processing  Members use the SENTRI/NEXUS/GE card at the card reader at the primary pedestrian booth. The CBP officer should be logged into SENTRI pedestrian lanes. The traveler is responsible for making an oral customs and agriculture declaration at the primary booth. The officer on primary will be notified of tC (by7ME)_ sy and the officer will send the traveler to secondary accordingly. In cases where the card does not read and no other equipment malfunctions exist, the traveler will be sent to secondary.

NEXUS Program Specifics Both CBP and CBSA vet NEXUS applications. Both CBP and CBSA must deem the applicant as low-risk in order for the applicant to be approved in NEXUS. Applicants must attend a joint enrollment interview at a NEXUS EC, where they are interviewed by both CBP and CBSA. 44.1. NEXUS Program Benefits NEXUS members may use the SENTRI lanes at southern land border ports of entry provided they travel in a SENTRI registered vehicle and comply with SENTRI requirements. NEXUS members can also use the SENTRI pedestrian lanes. Approved GE and SENTRI members who are in possession of a TTP RFID enabled card may use the NEXUS lanes entering the U.S. at land border locations and by sea for small boats. 11.2. Shared Data between U.S. and Canadian Officers CBP can share only CBP-owned records from TECS or GES with Canadian officers for official law enforcement purposes. For records owned by other agencies in TECS or GES, the Third-Party Rule does apply. CBP must obtain written permission for the disclosure to third parties of any confidential information received. The sharing may take place pursuant to the ‘Statement of Mutual Understanding” (SMU) signed in 1999 by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and the Department of State (DOS). The document was updated in 2003 (See Appendix A). Many of INS and CIC functions now reside with CBP and CBSA. The arrangement remains in effect and is honored by all signatories. The arrangement provides for the sharing of a wide variety of information “to assist in the effective administration and enforcement of the Participants’ citizenship and immigration laws” and “to facilitate the secure flow of people to Canada or the U.S. through co-operative border management....” See Article 5 of the SMU for a list of the types of information covered by the arrangement. Any sharing must comply with all the terms of the SMU. Questions regarding the procedure for requesting or providing information pursuant to the SMU should be directed to the local Associate or Assistant Chief Counsel or the Office of International Affairs. For NEXUS and FAST North, the sharing of information takes place in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding for the Disclosure of Information for the Purposes of the Joint Alternative Presentation and Inspection Programs, which is an arrangement between CBP and the CBSA (initially made by their agency predecessors), signed in February 2005. In addition, sharing information under these circumstances is permitted as a routine use of the information under the system of records notices for both TECS and GES. Both CBP and CBSA must ensure that the proper disclosure of information regarding a violation or potential violation of the law is to a designated official (i.e., EC Supervisor). CBP officers must NOT request information on an applicant from a CBSA officer in a manner other than the normal procedure by which information is exchanged. Canadian laws and regulations prohibit the release of certain types of information, such as suspicion of criminal association or a conviction for which a pardon has been received. Only CBSA should release applicant information, and only through 35 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000041',\n",

The request will be submitted in writing and the Canadian agency will treat the information as strictly confidential in accordance with Article 6 of the updated SMU. All such requests will be documented. To the extent information to be exchanged is not owned by CBP, CBP officers must seek authorization from the owner-agency before releasing such information to CBSA.  11.3. NEXUS Air Processing  During the NEXUS enrollment interview, CBSA may collect biometrics for each approved applicant so that the applicant can use the NEXUS self-serve kiosks for expedited entry when entering Canada by air. NEXUS members are not required to complete a paper CBSA Declaration Card (Form E311) when using a self-serve kiosk at any Canadian airport where NEXUS is available. The kiosk is activated by inserting the NEXUS card and validating identity and membership through a facial comparison and/or iris scan. The CBSA is modernizing the way NEXUS members are processed at Canadian airports. The existing NEXUS kiosks that use iris recognition technology are being replaced with new, modernized NEXUS kiosks that use facial verification technology. The new kiosks are now available at:  1. Toronto Pearson International Airport,  2. Vancouver International Airport,  3. Montréal-Trudeau International Airport,  4. Halifax Stanfield International Airport,  5. Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport,  6. Edmonton International Airport, and  7. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.  e Non-NEXUS members cannot accompany a NEXUS member through a NEXUS kiosk, regardless of age.  e Travelers crossing the border in the air, land, or sea modes of transportation with currency or monetary instruments valued at $10,000 or more, cannot use NEXUS.

U.S. and Canadian citizens are exempted.  When entering the U.S. as a NEXUS member through Preclearance locations in Canada or at U.S. airports, members may use either their NEXUS card or their passport at the GE border processing technology for expedited entry by following the below steps:  1. Proceed to the designated GE area located in the U.S. preclearance area.  2. Follow the prompts on the screen and complete the entry process.  3. Provide the receipt that prints out to the CBP officer.  4. Proceed to the trans-border lounge unless you are directed to an inspection area.  36 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000042',\n",
       " 'Only the GE border processing technologies located in U.S. Preclearance areas at Canadian airports will accept a NEXUS card. When entering the U.S. from other airports, you must use your passport to receive NEXUS/GE privileges.  The NEXUS card is an approved travel document under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) for citizens of the U.S. and Canada. NEXUS members that are U.S. LPRs or Canadian Landed Immigrants are still required to carry proof of lawful permanent residency or Canadian Landed Immigrant status while using NEXUS to enter Canada. At the GE border processing technology, U.S. LPRs will use their Lawful Permanent Resident card. Canadian Landed Immigrants must have the appropriate passport and visa or ESTA that corresponds to their country of citizenship in order to use the GE border processing technology.  11.4, NEXUS Land Processing  NEXUS members may use any vehicle, including rental, recreational, and/or motorcycles in the NEXUS lane. Vehicles with another vehicle in tow are not restricted from utilizing the NEXUS lanes. The driver of the vehicle will hold the SENTRI/NEXUS/GE card(s) in front of the RFID reader prior to reaching the primary booth. The CBP officer on primary will ensure that the correct license plate information is queried in TECS. The license plate entered by the license plate reader must be compared to the actual license plate on the vehicle in the Dedicated Commuter Lane (DCL). If the license plate reader reads the plate incorrectly, the reader is inoperable, or the lane lacks a reader, the CBP officer must manually enter the correct plate number.

Vehicle registration is not a requirement of the NEXUS program. There are no restrictions from a vehicle towing another vehicle, a travel trailer, or a trailer with a boat, ATV, snowmobile, or other such item from utilizing the NEXUS lanes. Rental vehicles can also be used at the NEXUS lanes. Some Ports of Entry may restrict this type of vehicle based on the configuration of the port rather than restrictions of the program. 11.5. NEXUS Marine Processing TTP members who arrive by private boat will notify arrival (i.e., CBP One and/or CBP ROAM) to the nearest port of entry or designated reporting center. Each person on the boat must be a TTP member and have a Trusted Traveler card (NEXUS, SENTRI or GE) in order to use the NEXUS reporting benefit. Otherwise, regular reporting requirements must be followed, which may include reporting in person. TTP members are only required to report if they have touched foreign soil, have had contact with a foreign hovering vessel, or have received merchandise outside the U.S. territorial waters. The information can be found on the CBP web page for Small Boats or the corresponding arrival area. When entering the U.S., the boat master does the following: ¢ Call the local CBP marine reporting number for that arrival area. Please refer to the U.S. CBP website for the reporting telephone numbers at: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/pleasure-boats- private-flyers/pleasure-boat-locations. e@ Provide advance notice to CBP at least 30 minutes (minimum) and up to four hours (maximum) before arriving in the U.S. The boat master must provide the following:  ©  anestimated time of arrival;  othe name and location of the landing site of arrival;  othe registration number and/or name of the boat;  othe full name, date of birth and country of citizenship and/or permanent residence status of all NEXUS members on board;  othe destination, purpose of the trip and length of stay in the U.S. for each traveler; and  othe passport and visa details of travelers when applicable or required.  o Ensure that all travelers have photo identification and proof of citizenship, permanent residence status and/or other immigration status documents when applicable or required; and  o Declare all goods being imported, including related currency information.  If a CBP officer is not at the specified landing site to meet the boat at the reported estimated time of arrival or actual time of arrival, the individuals who have reported may proceed to their intended final destination. CBP officers will take the appropriate information and enter that information into the small boat reporting system. CBP officers will determine if each person on the vessel is a TTP member and cardholder. CBP officers will receive an oral CBP declaration from all members for goods and currency being imported. TTP members may report arrival by private boat via phone even if they exceed their personal exemption.

       " \"12. FAST Program Specifics FAST processing is a privilege granted by CBP to members of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) at the land border. Under specific conditions, FAST affords expedited release to trucks in supply chains where the highway carrier, importer and (on the southern border) manufacturer are all members of CTPAT and the driver is a credentialed CBP TTP member enrolled in either FAST North or FAST South. The FAST benefit includes dedicated lanes for CTPAT partners at many Canada/Mexico land border ports of entry. CTPAT highway carriers view the FAST lanes as a substantial benefit as the use of these lanes saves them considerable time in crossing the border. Moreover, since CTPAT highway carriers are transporting cargo from CTPAT importers, these shipments are considered low-risk and are therefore subject to lower examination rates. Finally, CTPAT highway carriers have a competitive advantage over non-CTPAT Partners, since most CTPAT Partner importers require that those business partners in the supply chain which are eligible for CTPAT membership —such as highway carriers — become and remain CTPAT in order to conduct business with them. Please note that FAST members do not receive any additional TTP benefits (i.e., GE, Nexus, SENTRI and APEC) or TSA Pre-Check. 12.1. FAST Program Benefits The benefits of FAST participation include: * Dedicated lanes (where available) for greater speed and efficiency in the clearance of FAST shipments; e Reduced number of examinations and front-of-the-line priority in secondary processing; e  Astrong and ongoing partnership with the CBSA/Partners in Protection (PIP) and CBP CTPAT administrations; e Enhanced supply chain security and safety while protecting the economic prosperity of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada; * For carrier participants, the knowledge that they are transporting shipments for a CTPAT approved importer, and on the southern border, a CTPAT manufacturer; and, « Rapid Business Resumption in the event of future terrorist events. FAST participation requirements along the northern and southern border are very similar with minor exceptions. For the northern border, the driver, carrier, and importer must all participate in the FAST Driver/CTPAT programs in order to be eligible for FAST processing. On the Southern border, the manufacturer must also be an approved CTPAT participant. FAST North is a bi-national program administered jointly by CBP and CBSA for expedited release into both countries. FAST South is administered exclusively by CBP for expedited release into the U.S. only with inbound traffic management assisted by Mexican authorities. 12.2. Processing FAST Members As the driver approaches the primary inspection lane, the FAST RFID chip enabled card must be held up to the reader, which retrieves the associated account and displays the driver's information on the screen inside the booth. The CBP officer must rely on Truck Manifest Module (TMM) messaging to distinguish fully qualified FAST trips from other uses of the FAST commercial driver credential. The officer must also ensure that the photograph on the FAST card matches the driver. The RFID decal on the cab of the truck will activate the TMM system. 40 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000046\",\n",
       " 'The CBP officer will process the driver. Enrollment in the FAST commercial driver program does not exempt the driver from documentary or other admissibility requirements. If the antenna cannot read the FAST RFID chip enabled card, information may be captured by scanning the barcode printed on the FAST card or by manually typing the ID number located on the back of the FAST card.  FAST commercial drivers must present their FAST commercial driver card, and necessary admissibility documents to CBP or CBSA personnel when using FAST or when hauling placarded hazardous material (non-U.S. LPRs only). All occupants in the conveyance must have a valid and activated FAST card prior to arriving at the border. All occupants must have a valid FAST card at the time of crossing to utilize the FAST lanes, otherwise, regular service lanes must be used. Drivers may not transfer or share the card with another individual. FAST participants may not engage in ‘cabotage’ — or ‘point to point’ movement of commercial shipments within the U.S.. FAST membership satisfies HAZ-MAT background check requirements for Canadian and Mexican drivers.  13. APEC Program Specifics  APEC expedites travel for qualified businesspeople within the APEC region, which facilitates business, promotes free open trade and investment, and bolsters the U.S. economy.  A “verified businessperson” engaged in APEC business means a person engaged in the trade of goods, the provision of services or the conduct of investment activities in the APEC region. A “U.S. government official” means a U.S. government official performing U.S. government activities that support the work of APEC.  APEC gives frequent business travelers:  e Expedited entry and exit through special APEC lanes at participating airports; and,  « Multiple, short-term entries to precleared APEC economies without having to make a separate visa application to fully participating members. U.S. and Canadian ABTC holders do not receive this benefit.  14. Trusted Traveler Secondary Processing 14.1.

The sole exception to this is when a declaration referral is generated, and the member is referred to Baggage Control. When the receipt has an “X” across the front with “REPORT TO PASSPORT CONTROL,” members will not be diverted back to stand in the primary lanes and will receive “head of the line privileges” when waiting for processing at Primary.

A TTP member may be cleared at primary if the CBP officer is able to resolve the reason for the referral. If the TTP member is cleared on primary, the back of the GE border processing technology receipt is to be stamped with the CBP officer’s admission stamp, indicating the TTP member cleared CBP processing. The receipt must be returned to the TTP member to present at egress if applicable. If the TTP member is referred to secondary, the member must be escorted and processed expeditiously (“head of the line” over non-GE/ TTP secondary referrals). The secondary CBP officer must conduct an enforcement examination as necessary and address the code on the referral receipt. A written declaration via CBP Form 6059B may be used but is not required. Once it is determined that the TTP member may be released from secondary, the secondary CBP officer must stamp the GE border processing technology receipt on the back to indicate the TTP member’s admission. A stamped GE border processing technology receipt must be returned to the TTP member to present at egress if applicable. In the event that a U.S. LPR or non-U.S. citizen member receives a referral receipt, the CBP officer must enroll the member in the appropriate system in addition to addressing the referral reason on the receipt.  14,3. FAST Secondary Referrals When fully qualified FAST trips (those with a FAST Driver and CTPAT approved importer, carrier, and [Southern Border only] manufacturer) are selected for secondary examination, “Head-of-the-line” privileges will be provided for all Non-Intrusive Inspections and secondary examinations to include other government agency examinations. 15. The Ombudsman Process  15.1. Ombudsman Discretion The Ombudsman will respond, in accordance with CBP policies and procedures, to inquiries from denied or revoked TTP applicants. Sensitive and non-routine cases, or those requiring special attention, will be routed through the CBP Headquarters TTP Program office to the Ombudsman for review. The Supervisory Ombudsman, on behalf of the Executive Director Admissibility and Passenger Programs (XD APP), may also approve membership for those who do not meet eligibility criteria if it is determined that discretion is warranted, and the applicant presents a low risk. If the Ombudsman or Supervisory  44 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000050',\n",

Applicants should be provided with the specific reason for  denial, such as a criminal conviction, or immigration violation. If the reason cannot be provided; (b)(7)(E) | meet program eligibility requirements. Denied applicants should be advised that no appeal is available for the decision. If the applicant/member believes he/she was denied/revoked based on incorrect/inaccurate information, the matter may be forwarded to the Ombudsman for resolution. A CBP Supervisor, a GS-13 or above, should approve the forwarding of the reconsideration request to the Ombudsman, if done by the Enrollment Center on behalf of the applicant/member. All correspondence intended for the Ombudsman’s intervention should be uploaded into GES for the Ombudsman review If an applicant makes a claim that the information is incorrect (such as a record of a criminal conviction), enrollment centers should check and confirm that the information on which the denial is based is accurate. This should include the positive identification of the applicant to confirm an exact match. The Ombudsman will consider whether or not the applicant has an overall compliant travel history since the date of denial or revocation and if so, whether the applicant can be considered a low-risk traveler despite failure to meet the discretionary criteria. In other words, the Ombudsman’s primary role should be considering whether or not applicants who fall outside the Strict Standard should be recommend for approval for Trusted Traveler status. The Ombudsman functions independently of CBP Headquarters _  pr \"(b)(7)(E).___| therefore should make such determination free from any outside influence (©); officer in the field believes the Ombudsman has made an error, the officer must convey the facts through their chain of command before being forwarded to CBP Headquarters or the Ombudsman for further review. The Ombudsman discretion is paramount to the success CBP’s TTPs. It is difficult to outline every instance where Ombudsman discretion is warranted; however, the following outlines examples of conditions under which favorable discretion should be granted.  15.2, Denials Based on Vetting and/or Enrollment Interview For denials based on!

       " '15.3. Denials and Revocations Based on Border Violations For denials or revocations based on a border violation, the Ombudsman will review all applicable reports, statements, records, and inquiries to determine the intent of the traveler during the incident. The Ombudsman will consider whether or not the person intentionally deceived CBP or if it was an honest mistake. In addition, the Ombudsman will consider the following factors to determine if the applicant should be approved and/or reinstated: Regardless of whether a review leads to the exercise of discretion, the Ombudsman must document the review with appropriate comments and records in GES. The GES record must list the factors considered in each decision, along with any supporting documents submitted by the applicant. The GES record must fully explain the basis for each decision. 16. Violations, Revocations, and Denials 16.1. Violations Any violation of U.S. law or TTP rules can result in membership revocation. Circumstances that may result in revocation of TTP benefits include, but are not limited to, circumstances in which the member: e Fails to carry the Trusted Traveler card while using the TTP lanes (not applicable at the GE border processing technology). e Allows the use of the Trusted Traveler card by a non-participant. e Knowingly transports non-participants in a DCL. * Knowingly facilitates the entry of a non-member through an air GE border processing technology. e Alters the Trusted Traveler card. e Fails to disclose material information, which may have rendered the individual ineligible for the program. « Fails to declare merchandise. e Fails to comply with vessel reporting requirements. e Fails to report updates in citizenship status or admissibility documents that impact eligibility for membership in the program. 46 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000052',\n",

AIL TTP members must notify CBP of any changes in information submitted since the last application, such as immigration status and change in vehicle plates. Any change in immigration status must be reported by visiting an enrollment center. 16.2. DCL Violations The DCL Violations rule applies to all TTP and Non-TTP Members as follows:  e TTP Members — if they do not present their membership cards, knowingly or unknowingly (i.e., lost, stolen, forgotten, or misplaced) then the TTP member will get a violation for each encounter.  e Non-TTP Members (i.e., no tags) — if the non-TTP member uses DCL lanes, knowingly or unknowingly, without being an active TTP member, then he/she will get a violation for each encounter.  # Once the TTP or non-TTP member reaches a total of three violations, they will be subject to either membership revocation, penalties, or vehicle seizure.  e@ The DCL Violations will be recorded in Simplified Arrival, and the violations will either be automatically generated by the system, or the system will allow the CBP officer to manually annotate the violation (see tables below).  Once the system reaches or exceeds the maximum number of violations, or if the system generates a mandatory referral, the TTP and/or non-TTP member will be referred for a secondary inspection where the action will be determined by CBP.  16.3. FAST Violations  As part of normal cargo processing, whenever a violation is detected, a CBP officer must ensure the CTPAT portal and FAST databases are queried to determine if any parties (driver, carrier, importer, manufacturer, and consignee) are FAST Driver or CTPAT participants. CBP officers can verify the CTPAT status of importers, manufacturers, and carriers in the CTPAT portal. For driver information, the CBP officers may query the FAST Driver database GES if they have access or they can contact the nearest EC. A CTPAT Supply Chain Specialist (SCSS) must be notified promptly of any positive findings on an importer, manufacturer, or carrier. The nearest EC Supervisor must be promptly notified of any positive findings on a driver. The name of the assigned SCSS can be identified by logging into the CTPAT portal. Or, in the assigned CTPAT SCSS can also be identified in the TMM. An officer working secondary can select the CTPAT link through the Truck Manifest Secondary dropdown. Additionally, if there is company involvement, CTPAT companies must be identified as a CTPAT participant if an incident record is recorded in SEACATS. e Identifying CTPAT/FAST Approved Carrier 47 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000053\",\n",

Both actions must be taken to gain access to the CTPAT web portal. The status of a carrier or company can change at any time. It is important that carrier names are verified in the CTPAT portal. Any FAST carriers discovered in violation of Federal laws must list the following data in the incident/seizure report created by the CBPO: In regards to FAST violations, the EC supervisor will review the details of the seizure or penalty and may contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for assistance in determining the driver’s culpability or involvement in the smuggling. If it is determined that the driver was not culpable, the EC supervisor may return the FAST card to the member with full privileges. If the driver was found to be culpable or negligent, the EC will deactivate the card, revoke the membership, and notify the driver of his ineligibility. 16.4, Cuba Travel There are eleven categories of legal travel under the Cuba General License: e Family visits e Official business for the U.S. government, foreign government, and certain intergovernmental organizations e Journalism e Professional research « Religious activities e Public performances e Support for the Cuban people @ Humanitarian projects e Activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes e  xportation, importation or transmission of information or informational materials e Certain export transactions The only required documentation needed to satisfy the Cuba General License is a self-declared reason for travel. CBP may ask for a detailed itinerary presented upon re-entry into the U.S., detailing the traveler’s time spent in Cuba to validate that travel met one of the above categories.

Also, individuals are not required to obtain specific licenses from OFAC if their travel is covered by a general license. CBP accepts the admission of the traveler upon re-entry as evidence the travel met the Cuban General License requirements. Therefore, GE enrollment centers should not require an affidavit (detailed itinerary) from a GE applicant during the enrollment process. If it is discovered that the traveler entered and exited Cuba from a third country, which circumvents the U.S. restrictions (in cases such as third country travel to Cuba for tourism and does not fall within one of the eleven categories would be unapproved travel to Cuba and would violate TTP policies) the traveler TTP membership should be revoked/denied.  16.5. Revocations — Port Processes A CBP Supervisor at the port of entry must be consulted prior to referring a possible revocation of a TTP member to the EC. Any violation of TTP rules when a member is in the FIS must be reported to the local When a violation involving a TTP member occurs:  e The CBP officer will retrieve the violator’s card with supervisory approval and forward it to the EC supervisor along with a copy of the (b)(7)(E)_| report of the incident.  e The traveler should be advised to address all inquiries to the EC;  e EC possibly revokes the membership in GES;  ® The details of the revocation should be documented in the comments section in the GES record; and  e GES automatically emails a revocation letter to the former member.  « The TTP member will be given a verbal explanation of why the membership may possibly be revoked by the EC supervisor. In addition, the CBP supervisor will provide the contact information in writing for the EC that includes: a point of contact name; the telephone number; and EC hours of operation.  e An EC supervisor must be consulted prior to the revocation of any member.  49 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000055',\n",

Revocations and Denials — Enrollment Center Revocation decisions must be finalized within two days. If a final decision for revocation/denial of participation in the program is made, the enrollment center or EoA will enter reasons for revocation into GES so that a letter or notification can by generated by the system and sent to the member or posted to their TTP account. If the final decision is that the member remain in the program, the CBP officer will notify the member. Whenever a TTP applicant is denied or a current TTP member is revoked, the EC or EoA officer must enter as much information as possible regarding the denial or revocation into the comments section in the GES. This is important for program audit purposes and any future analysis or reviews. Denied applicants and revoked members should be provided with the specific reason for denial or revocation, such as a criminal conviction, immigration violation, etc. CBP will make every effort to ensure correct information was relied upon to make the decision.

The Ombudsman will reserve the right to use discretion and overturn the denial. If an applicant/member feels the denial/revocation decision was based upon inaccurate information, he/she may contact the local EC to speak with a supervisor. Whenever possible, the supervisor should resolve the issue and if necessary, contact the TTP Headquarters Program Office for review of the application. If the supervisor cannot resolve the issue and the applicant/member believes the denial/revocation was based on incorrect or inaccurate information, the applicant/member may file a Reconsideration Request by logging into their TTP account. If eligible to file a Reconsideration Request, he/she will find the Request Reconsideration button in the Program Memberships section of the Dashboard. In the instance when a minor initially enrolls in a TTP and the parent or guardian is later revoked from the program, a minor should not be automatically revoked. The decision to revoke should be based on the totality of circumstances. If the CBP officer decides that the minor cannot continue with his or her low-risk status based on the actions of the parent or guardian, the officer may revoke the minor. However, if the officer determines the minor is low-risk and the parent or guardian does not wish to have the minor’s membership cancelled, the child may remain in the program. The officer must have comprehensive comments added to GES in these circumstances to substantiate the decision. 16.7. Appeal of Denials or Revocations There is no formal appeal process for CBP denial or revocation of applications, but CBP will make every effort to ensure that accurate information was used, and appropriate decisions were reached. 16.8. Applicant Inquiries Applicants who have been denied or revoked and contact the enrollment center requesting further information should speak with the designated officer or CBP supervisor and be provided with as much information as can be properly provided based on CBP and TECS security policies, third agency considerations and any other policy and legal constraints. For example, to the extent consistent with law and CBP policy, the officer may disclose to the applicant or member CBP information that relates to that applicant/member which may include criminal records, fingerprint results, any voluntary disclosures by applicant, and information on customs, immigration, or agriculture violations. 52 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000058',\n",

If an applicant has been charged with a crime, then the interviewing officer must determine the date of the event(s), the severity of the offense(s), the disposition of the charge(s) and any sentencing/penalties associated with the conviction(s). If the disposition of a charge is unable to be determined, and the applicant is unable to provide pertinent court documents, then the applicant is considered to have been convicted of the charge for the purpose of adjudicating the trusted traveler program application. All felony charges for which the disposition is unknown must have supporting court documents attached in GES indicating the charge was either not pursued by the Prosecuting’s office, reduced to a misdemeanor, or dismissed. All felony convictions are disqualifying and render the applicant ineligible for TTP membership.  ¢ Applicants will be given 30 days to provide court documents when potentially disqualifying criminality is discovered for which the disposition of any of the charges is unclear. During this 30-day time frame, or until court documents are made available to the interviewing officer, the application shall remain in “conditionally approved” status and must not be approved. Pertinent comments indicating the applicant was provided 30 days to obtain court documents for specified offenses must be captured via internal GES comments. If an applicant fails to provide court documents or follow up with the enrollment center by the end of the 30-day period, the application may be denied in accordance with the TTP Strict Standard policy for GE,  58 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000064\",\n",

In addition, Annexes to this SMU are hereby incorporated by reference. The provisions of the SMU apply at all times to all exchanges of information unless otherwise specified in the Annexes. The Annexes address any additional requirements or provisions applicable to specific types of information described in the Annexes to the extent that those provisions are different from, or not described in, the SMU. Notwithstanding any language used herein, however, nothing in this SMU is intended to give rise to rights or obligations under international law; the SMU reflects the firm political commitments of the Participants to operate in accordance with the provisions detailed herein. Recognizing that border security and border management are based upon cooperation and collaboration, Canada and the United States are building on their existing joint cooperative efforts under mechanisms such as Border Vision, the Accord on Our Shared Border, and documents such as the Joint Statement on Cooperation on Border Security and Regional Migration Issues and the Smart Border Declaration; Recognizing that moving the focus of control of the movement of people away from our shared land border to overseas, where potential violators of citizenship or immigration laws are interdicted prior to their arrival in the United States and Canada enables Canada and the United States to manage more effectively their movement into and within North America. Canada and the U.S. are pursuing a regional approach to migration based on the Multiple Borders Strategy. The Multiple Borders Strategy views the border not as a geo-political line but rather a continuum of checkpoints along a route of travel from the country of origin to Canada or the United States. At every checkpoint along the travel continuum-- visa screening; airport check-in; points of embarkation; transit points; international airports and seaports; and the Canada-United States border -- there is an opportunity for the Participants to link the person and the document and any known intelligence; Considering that the effective administration and enforcement of citizenship and immigration laws in the United States and Canada are important to protect the health and safety of our populace, to maintain the security of our societies, and to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to our territories to persons who are criminals or security risks; Being convinced that greater cooperation through the exchange of information can make their actions in achieving these objectives more effective; the Participants have reached the following understandings:  63  CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000069',\n",
       " 'Article 1 Definitions  For purposes of this SMU the following definitions apply:  {a) “Citizenship and immigration laws” means the laws and regulations of the United States and Canada relating to admission, temporary entry, removal, naturalization, denaturalization, or loss of nationality.  1. On the United States side, this includes, but is not limited to: (a) the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); (b) the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment; (c) other immigration-related laws under any title of the United States Code or any other public laws; and (d) immigration-related Presidential Proclamations or Executive Orders.  2. On the Canadian side, this includes, but is not limited to: laws and regulations relating to (a) the consideration of requests for protection under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, or from torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention against Torture or risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; (b) any offences contained in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Citizenship Act, or the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act; and (c) any other immigration-related laws contained in an Act of Parliament.  (b) “Immigration-related laws” includes, but is not limited to, offences under the respective participants’ citizenship and immigration laws recited in (a) or any other conduct or circumstance, including criminal activity, that would render a person inadmissible to or removable from Canada or the United States or would otherwise affect the person’s immigration status.  (c) “Need to know” means a determination made by a Participant that specific information is needed by the requesting Participant in order to perform or assist in a lawful and authorized government function.  (d) “Information” includes, but is not limited to, all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics including electronic format, made or received by a Participant that concerns persons, businesses, organizations, entities, activity or statistical data.  (e) “Compelling need” means extraordinary circumstances where a Participant perceives that there is an urgency to take action and where failure to take the action could reasonably pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or group of individuals.  64 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000070',\n",
       " 'Article 2 Purpose and Scope  Nothing in this SMU is intended to change or modify the laws of the Participants.  Subject to the domestic laws of the United States and Canada, the Participants are to assist each other  by sharing information in accordance with the provisions of this SMU for the following purposes:  {a) To assist in the effective administration and enforcement of the Participants’ citizenship and immigration laws;  (b) To facilitate the secure flow of people to Canada or the United States through co-operative border management among the Participants; and  (c} To promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to the United States and Canada to persons who are criminals or security risks.  Article 3 Conditions for Exchange of Information Under the SMU  Unless otherwise specified in any Annex to this SMU, the Participants are to share information under the  SMU consistent with domestic law and the purposes set out in Article 2 if any of the following  circumstances exist:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to the administration or enforcement of the citizenship or immigration laws of either Canada or the United States;  (b) There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the information would be relevant to the prevention, investigation or punishment of conduct that would constitute a crime rendering a person inadmissible or removable under the citizenship or immigration laws of either Canada or the United States; or  (c) The information is to be used for statistical or research purposes, provided that the use of the information does not identify persons, and complies with each Participant’s laws and policies for such exchanges of information.  Article 4 Procedure for the Exchange of Information  (a) The sharing of information between the Participants is to be in accordance with the provisions of this SMU.  (b) All exchanges of information under this SMU, and requests, therefore, are to be made through the points of contact established pursuant to Article 7.

Where provided for in the Annexes, exchanges of information may also be by systematic exchange of information maintained in databases.  65 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000071',\n",
       " '(d) Information may also be shared at the initiative of the providing Participant, where that Participant has reason to suspect that the receiving Participant has a need to know the information for purposes of enforcing or administering its citizenship or immigration laws.  (e) The Participants are to make requests for information pursuant to Article 3, and in all cases requesting Participants are to provide the background and information necessary to enable the providing Participant to respond. All requests should identify the reason for the request, as well as the intended use of the information.  (f) When reasonably practicable, requests for information should be made in writing in either a paper or electronic format. If it is not reasonably practicable for a Participant to make a written request for the information prior to its receipt, the requesting Participant is to confirm the request in writing as soon thereafter as is possible.  (g) The Annexes to this SMU constitute prior written arrangements for the sharing of the information specified in the Annexes. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated in an Annex, further written requests for the information specified in the Annex are unnecessary.

Article 6 Subsequent Uses and Treatment  Subsequent uses and treatment of information shared under this SMU and its annexes are restricted by  the following conditions:  (a) Information is shared between the Participants pursuant to an express understanding of strict confidentiality. Such information, as well as inquiries and requests for information, received by a Participant under this SMU is to be accorded protection from disclosure to third parties as provided under the laws and policies of the receiving Participant with regard to such information;  (b) Receiving Participants are not to use or disclose the information provided under this SMU except for the purposes enumerated in Article 2 or the Annexes, or as otherwise required by the laws of the Participant;  (c)(i) The Participants are to obtain written permission for the disclosure to third parties of any confidential information received pursuant to this SMU prior to such disclosure, or as specified in the Annexes, unless there is a compelling need that would justify a Participant’s not making such a written request, in which case the requesting Participant is to give written notice of the disclosure to the providing Participant as soon as practicable; however  (ii) The Participants acknowledge that written permission is not required for disclosure of information to agencies participating as signatories of the SMU and other agencies in the performance of their citizenship, immigration or border management functions (including the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. Department of Defense, Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canadian Department of National Defense; Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or their successors and with oversight and review agencies within the United States and Canada);  (iii) A receiving Participant is to provide notice to any third party to which it discloses information received in confidence under the SMU that the third party is prohibited from further disclosure unless it obtains authorization from the providing Participant; and  67 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000073',\n",
       " '(d) To prevent the unauthorized disclosure, copying, use, or modification of information provided to a Participant under this SMU, receiving Participants are to restrict access to such information on a need-to-know basis, and use recognized security mechanisms such as passwords, encryption, or other reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized access.  Article 7 Designation of Officials  (a) The Participants are to designate officials for the purpose of exchanging information under this SMU and inform the other Participants in writing or electronically of any such designation or change to an existing designation.  (b) All exchanges of information pursuant to this SMU are to be between or among designated officials of the respective Participants.  Article 8 Original Documents  (a) Where a Participant receives original documents, such documents are to be returned to the providing Participant as soon as possible, or upon request of the providing Participant. If such documents cannot be returned within 15 calendar days of the receipt of the providing Participant’s request for their return, the receiving Participant is to notify the providing Participant so that the Participants may mutually determine the date by which the documents are to be returned.  (b) When requested to do so by the receiving Participant, the providing Participant is to certify copies of records as true and correct, in a form acceptable to each Participant.  Article 9 Exemption from the Obligation to Provide Information  Where the designated official of the Participant who would otherwise provide information pursuant to  this SMU is of the opinion that to do so would likely be inconsistent with its laws, or detrimental to its  national sovereignty, security, public policy, or other important national interest, the Participant may either decline to provide the information in whole or in part, or offer to provide the information in whole or in part subject to such terms and conditions as it may specify. The Participant requesting the information is to comply with such terms and conditions as a condition precedent to the information being provided.  Article 10 Procedure for Amending and Deleting Information  Where a Participant has supplied information that is later subject to amendment for reason of accuracy  of information, official policy, or legislative requirement, that Participant is to update the information in  its system. For periodic exchanges of information between the Participants, the receiving Participant is to update its records with the revised information. For specific case information, the receiving  Participant bears the responsibility of checking the providing Participant’s information for subsequent  updates. Participants are to exercise due diligence to ensure any actions taken are based on the most  current information.  68 CBP-OFO-2022-092322-000074',\n",
       " 'Article 11 Retention and Disposal The Participants’ respective domestic laws and policies regarding the retention and disposal of information received pursuant to this SMU are applicable. Article 12 Resolution of Disputes The Participants intend to resolve any disputes arising under this SMU by consultation among the Participants. A Participant who believes that information received under the SMU may have been improperly used or disclosed is to immediately notify the providing Participant. Participants are to take such steps as they mutually decide are reasonably necessary to ensure that no further improper uses or disclosure of information provided under this SMU occur. Article 13 Review The Participants to this SMU are to cooperate in a joint review of its provisions five years from the date of signature and every five years thereafter, or upon written request of a Participant. Failure to conduct a review does not, however, result in termination of this SMU. Article 14 Amendment This SMU and its Annexes may be amended only by written decision of the Participants. Article 15 Miscellaneous (a) Participants are to advise the others of all changes to their respective laws, regulations, or policies that could affect the operation or interpretation of this SMU. (b) Participants intend to develop implementing guidelines for this SMU. Participants plan to share these guidelines with each other. Nothing in this provision is intended to impose a specific timetable for the issuance of such guidance. Article 16 Duration Activities under this SMU commence on the date when all Participants have signed. Activities under the SMU cease sixty days after one Participant provides written notice to the others of its intention to no longer participate in the SMU.
